          THEORY FOR MOI
          While a ValueIterationAgent has
          a model of the environment via a MarkovDecisionProcess
          (see mdp.py) that is used to estimate Q-Values before
          ever actually acting

          Q(state,action) = R(state,action)+ Gamma * Max[Q(next state, all actions)]

           R= reward table (matrix)
           Q=matrix that represents the memory of what the agent has learnes through experience.
            -> the ROWS  of the Q matrix  represent the current state 
            -> the COLS represent possible actions leading to the next state 
          Initially the Q matrix is ZERO.

          A value assgined to a specific element in Q, is equal to the sum of the corresponding value in matrix R
          an the learning parameter Gamma, multiplied by the maximum value of Q for all possible actions in the next state 

          La suma es lo que me vale llegar de donde estoy a mi objt y luego la multilicaion y suma es lo que valdrian los siguiente pasos para llegar al goal.

          STEPS of the Q-learning alforithm:
            1.Initialize matrix Q to 0 -> meaning value = 0
            2.Get the transition table 
            3.For each episode: (each exploration, each time the agent explores to learn the map)
              3.1.Select a random initial state
              3.2.Do while the goal has not been reached. (explore until we find a way to get there)
                Select one among all the possible actions for the current state
                Using THIS chosen possible action, go to the next state
                Calculate the Q-value from this state (FORMULA)
                SET nextstate as CURRENT 
            end for 
          The algorithm tries to find the highest reward values recorded in the matrix for the current state 
            1.Set current state =initial state
            2.from current state, find the actual with the highest Q value.
            3.set current state= next state.
            4. repeat until current state 0 goal state
